# GOODASS Settings File Example
# This file should be placed at ~/.config/goodass/settings.yaml
# All settings are optional unless otherwise noted

# ============================================================================
# VERBOSITY LEVEL
# ============================================================================
# Controls the amount of output displayed and logging behavior
# 0 = Minimal (essential output only, no tables)
# 1 = Default (normal output, similar to standard behavior)
# 2 = Verbose (detailed output with additional information)
# 3 = Debug (full debug output, shows all process details, core dump on Ctrl+C)
verbosity: 1

# ============================================================================
# THREAD LIMITING
